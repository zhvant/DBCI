# DBCI
The DBCI is application for continuous integration (CI) of database code.  
  This application allows developers to upload database objects into file systems and version control systems, such as Git or SVN, and track changes over time.
The app is designed to streamline the workflow of database development teams by providing a simple tool for code collaboration and version control.   
  With this app, developers can easily manage and track changes to database objects, such as tables, stored procedures, and views, and ensure that all changes are properly tested and deployed.
The application provides a simple command line interface that allows developers to easily download database objects
using list of objects sent directly via console, external text file or even generated from SQL query.  
  Overall, the DBCI is a simple and powerful tool that can help development teams improve code quality, reduce errors, and increase productivity.
